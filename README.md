Build professional, personalized resumes in seconds using this AI-powered tool — designed for simplicity, speed, and beauty. Whether you're applying for a tech job or showcasing your unique talents, this resume builder helps you craft a job-ready document instantly.

### 🎯 Features

* 🧠 **AI-Generated Resume Templates** – Choose from 3 beautifully styled templates: Modern, Classic, and Creative.
* ✍️ **Editable Form** – Fill in your name, skills, education, and experience.
* 📝 **Instant Resume Generation** – See your resume preview in real-time as you type.
* 📄 **Download as Word (.docx)** – Export your resume in a professional Word format that you can edit, style, or upload to any job platform.

### ❓ Why Word Only?

We currently **support Word (.docx)** download only because:

* 📝 Word resumes are widely accepted by HR tools and job sites.
* 🧩 Exporting to PDF had layout issues across devices and didn't render correctly in some browsers.
* ✅ Word generation ensures **consistent formatting** and lets you edit after downloading.

> ⚠️ PDF support may be added later with full cross-browser compatibility.
